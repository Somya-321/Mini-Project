                <p>Extrusion is metal forming process which is widely used in industry. It is a type of manufacturing process that involves both shearing and compressive forces to shape material. In this process, a round billet is placed inside a chamber and forced through a die opening by a hydraulically driven ram or pressing stem. The die can have a round or complex cross-sectional shape, depending on the desired product. Typically, the process involves an axisymmetric die.

                <section id="history">
                <h1><b>History of Extrusion</b></h1>
                <p>Extrusion began in 1797 when Joseph Bramah used molten lead to make seamless pipes. In 1820, Thomas Burr created the first hydraulic press for lead tube extrusion. Over the 19th century, England led several advancements like bridge dies, indirect extrusion, and hydraulic systems.</p>
                <p>Alexander expanded extrusion to harder metals like brass in the late 1800s and is known as the ‚Äúfather of extrusion.‚Äù By the early 1900s, solid preheated billets replaced molten metal, and new tools like piercing systems and multi-part dies improved efficiency. Vertical and later horizontal presses became common for producing tubes.</p>
                <p> In the 1930s‚Äì1950s, electric heating and powerful presses enabled large-scale aluminum and alloy extrusion. Indirect and hydrostatic extrusion techniques developed later for specialized applications.</p>

                <section id="classification">
                <h1>Classification of Extrusion Processes:</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li><h2><b>Classification based on Extrusion direction:</b></h2></li>
                    <h3>Direct Extrusion( Forward Extrusion): </h3>
                    <p>The metal billet is placed inside a container and forced through a die using a ram. A dummy block or pressure plate is positioned at the end of ram to transfer force efficiently. This process requires extra force due to the friction between the billet and the container walls as the billet moves forward.</p>
                    <h3>Indirect Extrusion(Backward Extrusion/ Inverted Extrusion):</h3>
                    <p>In the indirect extrusion process, the die is attached to a hollow ram, which moves into a stationary billet enclosed within a container. This configuration eliminates relative motion between the billet and container walls, thereby minimizing frictional losses during deformation. As a result, the process requires significantly lower extrusion force compared to direct extrusion. However, the design constraints of the hollow ram limit the maximum load capacity and die dimensions, which can restrict the size and complexity of extrudable profiles. Despite these limitations, indirect extrusion is valued for its high dimensional precision and superior surface quality of the final product.</p>
                    <div><a href="direct and indirect extrusion img link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/direct-extrusion"><img src="Bimg1.jpeg" class="img"></a></div>
                    <h3>Lateral Extrusion(Vertical Extrusion):</h3>
                    <p>In lateral extrusion, the die opening is positioned on the side wall of the container, allowing the extrudate to flow perpendicularly to the direction of punch movement. When the punch compresses the billet from above, the material is forced laterally out through one or more die openings. This orthogonal metal flow makes the process suitable for forming long, slender components in a single stroke. This process is particularly suitable for materials with low melting points, as it facilitates easier metal flow and reduces forming loads.</p>

                    <li><h2><b>Classification based on Temperature:</b></h2></li>
                    <h3>Hot Extrusion:</h3>
                    <p>Hot Extrusion is a hot working process carried out above the recrystallization temperature of the material which prevents work hardening and facilitates easier deformation through the die. It is performed on horizontal hydraulic presses.The upper temperature limit for hot working is governed by hot shortness in alloys or the melting point in pure metals.</p>
                    <p>Lubricants such as oil or graphite are used for lower temperatures, while glass powder is applied at higher temperatures to reduce friction and wear. Hot working introduces several challenges: Oxidation of the billet and tooling, Softening of dies and tool, Lubrication difficulties, etc</p>

                    <h3>Cold Extrusion:</h3>
                    <p>Cold extrusion is a metal forming process conducted at or near ambient temperature. It offers several significant advantages over hot extrusion, including the absence of oxidation, enhanced mechanical properties due to strain hardening, improved dimensional accuracy, superior surface finish, and higher production speeds, particularly for materials susceptible to hot shortness.</p>
                    <p>Typical products manufactured through cold extrusion include collapsible tubes, fire extinguisher bodies, shock absorber cylinders, and gear blanks. These processes are especially suitable for the production of axisymmetric components, offering high precision and material efficiency.</p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion" class="btn-tooltip" title="Click to read the full paper">üîó</a>
                    <h3>Warm Extrusion:</h3>
                    <p>Warm extrusion occurs at temperatures above room temperature but below the recrystallization temperature of the material. This process is employed to optimize the balance between the required forming forces, material ductility, and the desired mechanical properties of the final extruded product.</p>

                    <li><h2><b>Classification based on Pressure application</b></h2></li>
                    
                    <h3>Hydrostatic Extrusion</h3>
                    <p>Hydrostatic extrusion is a specialized metal forming process in which the billet is subjected to uniform hydrostatic pressure, unlike conventional extrusion where the billet expands to fill the container. This method eliminates friction between the billet and the container walls, resulting in a more consistent pressure profile, improved surface finish, and higher dimensional accuracy. It allows for the extrusion of materials with high length-to-diameter ratios, including wires and irregular cross-sections.</p>
                    <p>However, hydrostatic extrusion is generally limited to cold or warm working because the pressurized fluid used cannot withstand high temperatures. Variants like augmented hydrostatic extrusion add axial force to improve flow, and advanced methods such as thick-film extrusion, Fuchs‚Äô process, and gear-driven systems enable efficient high-volume production.</p>

                    <h3>Impact Extrusion</h3>
                    <p>Impact extrusion is a specialized metal forming process employed to produce short, hollow components‚Äîsuch as collapsible tubes used in packaging applications. The process may be conducted using either direct or indirect extrusion principles and is typically carried out on high-speed mechanical presses. Although classified as a cold-working technique, the rapid deformation during the operation results in a significant increase in temperature. Impact extrusion is particularly well-suited for soft metals, including aluminum, lead, tin, and copper, due to their high ductility and low flow stress.</p>

                    <h3>Friction Extrusion</h3>
                    <p>Friction extrusion is an advanced metal forming process introduced in the early 1990s. Unlike traditional methods using a stationary billet, it involves rotating the billet relative to the die, generating frictional heat that softens the material and enables plastic deformation without external heating.</p>
                    <p>This technique improves material flow, refines grain structure, and is ideal for producing high-performance components from powders, chips, or recycled materials.</p>

                <h1>Extrusion Equipment</h1>
                <p>Extrusion is predominantly performed using hydraulic presses, which are categorized as either vertical or horizontal based on the orientation of the ram movement.</p>
                <h2>Vertical Extrusion Presses:</h2>
                <p>These presses, ranging in capacity from 3 to 20 MN, are known for their precise alignment, higher production efficiency, and reduced floor space requirements. However, they require additional headroom, and a floor pit is often needed for longer extrusions. These presses are preferred for producing thin-wall tubing, where uniform wall thickness and concentricity are critical.</p>
                <h2>Horizontal Extrusion Presses:</h2>
                <p>More commonly used in commercial extrusion for bars and complex shapes, typically having capacities between 15 MN and 50 MN. Despite their versatility, they may suffer from non-uniform cooling, leading to potential warping and inconsistent tube wall thickness unless the container is internally heated.</p>

                <section id="additional">
                <h2>Additional Equipment for Extrusion:</h2>
                <p>In addition to the primary extrusion press, several auxiliary systems are essential to ensure efficient and continuous operation. These include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Billet heating systems, which prepare the material to the required temperature for extrusion.</li>
                        <li>Automated billet transfer mechanisms, facilitating the precise and timely loading of billets into the container.</li>
                        <li>Extrusion container heating systems, employed when maintaining consistent thermal conditions within the container is necessary.</li>
                        <li>Hot saw units, utilized for cutting extruded profiles to desired lengths and for removing the discard (also known as the butt).</li>
                        <li>Carbon block extrusion systems, which enable complete billet extrusion, thereby eliminating residual butt material.</li>
                        <li>Runout tables, designed to support and guide the extruded product as it exits the press.</li>
                        <li>Profile straighteners, used to correct minor distortions or warpage in the extruded sections, ensuring dimensional accuracy and structural integrity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                </section>
                <section id="design">
                <h1>Extrusion Tooling and Die Design </h1>
                <p>Extrusion tooling is engineered to withstand high mechanical stress, thermal shock, and oxidation. A typical die assembly includes a high-alloy steel die, supported by a die holder, bolster, and mounted in a die head. The die is placed within a container liner, enclosed by a pressure-resistant container. The extrusion ram is protected by a follower pad, both of which require periodic replacement due to wear from repeated heating cycles.</p>
                <p>Extrusion dies are primarily of two types: flat-faced and conical. Flat-faced dies form an internal shear zone or "dead zone" and usually have a parallel land to maintain dimensional accuracy. Conical dies, used with lubrication, help reduce pressure and improve material flow. However, overly steep die angles may raise friction. Hence, a semi-die angle between 45¬∞ and 60¬∞ is considered optimal for balanced performance.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="speed">
                <h1>Effect of Extrusion Speed </h1>
                <p>Extrusion speed significantly impacts process efficiency and product quality. As ram speed increases, the required extrusion pressure also rises, approximately a 50% increase for every tenfold rise in speed. At lower speeds, the billet may cool during the process, especially in direct extrusion, leading to higher resistance and increasing pressure. This effect is more pronounced with high-strength alloys at elevated temperatures.</p>
                <p>Conversely, higher speeds generate heat through deformation, which can aid extrusion but also risk hot shortness, making the material brittle. Thus, maintaining optimal temperature is essential to balance ease of extrusion and material integrity.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="characteristics">
                <h1>Deformation Characteristics in Extrusion </h1>
                <p>During extrusion, the deformation of the billet can vary based on factors like friction and temperature. When there is low friction between the billet and the container wall which is achieved through good lubrication, hydrostatic pressure, or indirect extrusion‚Äîthe metal flows uniformly toward the die, resulting in homogeneous deformation.</p>
                <p>However, when friction increases, especially along the container walls, deformation becomes uneven. A dead zone of stagnant material may form near the die corners, while the center of the billet stretches and the edges experience shear. This leads to redundant work, which consumes energy without contributing to shaping the product.</p>
                <p>In extreme cases of high friction or when the billet surface is cooled by the container, a shear plane may form inside the billet. This causes the metal to separate internally, leaving a thin skin behind while only the fresh interior material gets extruded.</p>

                <section id="defects">
                <h1> Defects in  Extrusion</h1>
                <p>Extrusion processes can lead to several types of defects based on metal flow behavior, temperature, and friction. These defects can be broadly classified into internal defects, end defects, and surface defects.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Internal Defects:</b>
                        <p>The internal pipe defect occurs in direct extrusion when the central part of the billet moves faster than the outer regions, causing the oxidized outer surface to fold inward and form oxide stringers within the product. This is worsened by high friction at the container wall or a cold billet surface. Preventive measures include stopping extrusion early or using a follower block to remove surface oxides.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The center burst or chevron cracking is another internal defect that appears at low extrusion ratios and when billet-container friction is too low. It results from internal tensile stresses during deformation. Increasing friction and optimizing flow can help prevent this issue.</li>
                    <li><b>End Defects:</b>
                        <p>The axial hole or funnel defect occurs at the end of extrusion if the process continues until only a thin billet remains. The remaining material flows rapidly into the die, leaving a cavity at the billet's rear. Using a ram with a chamfered or angled face can reduce the likelihood of this defect.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Surface Defects:</b>
                        <p>Surface cracking, also referred to as fir-tree cracking, typically arises in hot extrusion due to high ram speeds or tensile stresses at the die exit. These conditions lead to transverse or rough surface cracks. The defect is often linked to hot shortness and excessive sticking friction at the die land. Reducing speed or optimizing die design can mitigate this problem.</p>
