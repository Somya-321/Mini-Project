                <p>Rolling is the metalworking process of plastically deforming metal by passing it between rolls. It involves two opposing rollers with a metal workpiece passing between them. The roller gap is smaller than the metal's initial thickness, causing it to move forward. As it passes through, the thickness decreases while length and width increase, keeping the volume constant. It is the most widely used forming process due to its high production rates and precise control over product dimensions.</p>

                <section id="history">
                <h1>History of the Rolling Process</h1>
                <p> The rolling process has a long and significant history, dating back several centuries. Early rolling devices were manually operated and primarily used to flatten precious metals such as gold and silver for the production of jewelry and decorative art. Notably, in 1480, Leonardo da Vinci sketched a design for a machine intended to roll lead for use in stained glass windows, this sketch represents the earliest recorded concept of a rolling mill, although there is no concrete evidence that the machine was ever constructed</p>
                <p>The advent of the Industrial Revolution, spanning approximately from the 1760s to the 1840s, brought about a dramatic increase in the demand for iron. This surge led to the development of new technologies for the production of iron and eventually steel. These advancements facilitated the widespread application of rolled metals in emerging industries such as machinery manufacturing, railway construction, and steamship production.</p>

                <section id="Terminology">
                <h1>Terminology in Rolling Processes</h1>
                <h2>Bloom</h2>
                <p>A bloom is a semi-finished hot-rolled product obtained from the initial breakdown of an ingot. It typically has a roughly square cross-section where the width is approximately equal to the thickness. The cross-sectional area of a bloom generally exceeds 230 cm². Blooms serve as intermediate forms that are further processed into structural shapes such as I-beams, rails, and other heavy sections.</p>
                <h2>Billet</h2>
                <p>A billet is produced by further hot-rolling a bloom and is characterized by a smaller, more refined cross-section, typically with a minimum size of 40 × 40 mm.</p>
                <h2>Slab</h2>
                <p>A slab is a hot-rolled flat product with a cross-sectional area greater than 100 cm² and a width that is at least twice its thickness. Slabs are also semi-finished products, primarily used as feedstock for further rolling into plates, sheets, or strips. Their flat geometry makes them suitable for downstream operations in the manufacture of flat-rolled steel products.</p>
                <h2>Plate</h2>
                <p>Plate refers to a flat-rolled product that has a thickness greater than 6 mm. Plates are often used in applications that require high strength and durability, such as in construction, shipbuilding, pressure vessels, and heavy machinery. Although the threshold thickness for plates may vary slightly depending on the width and specific industrial standards, 6 mm is the general benchmark.</p>
                <h2>Sheet</h2>
                <p>A sheet is a flat-rolled product with a thickness of 6 mm or less. Sheets are commonly produced through cold rolling and are valued for their fine surface finish and enhanced mechanical properties. They are widely used in industries such as automotive, appliance manufacturing, and packaging, where precision and surface quality are critical.</p>
                <h2>Strip</h2>
                <p> Strip refers to a flat-rolled product similar to sheet but with a narrower width, generally less than or equal to 600 mm. It is typically produced in coil form and used in applications that demand tight dimensional tolerances and uniformity, such as in electronics, forming processes, and precision components. Strip rolling is often integrated with annealing and finishing operations to enhance formability and performance.</p>

                <h1>Types of Rolling</h1>
                <h2>Hot Rolling</h2>
                <p>Hot rolling involves the metal working process that occurs when the metal pieces are heated above recrystallization temperature. It is the most widely used rolling method by volume, preserving an equiaxed grain structure that prevents work hardening. </p>
                <p>Raw materials such as billets, slabs, and blooms from casting are heated, typically through soaking pits or induction heating, before being passed through rollers. This approach enhances formability and reduces energy costs, while also improving process efficiency and minimizing surface defects. </p>
                <p>However, uneven cooling can introduce residual stresses and reduce tensile properties through the thickness. Hot-rolled products are commonly used in automotive components, agricultural machinery, food processing equipment, and infrastructure such as guardrails.</p>
                <div><img src="Cimg2.png" class="img"></div>
                <h2>Cold Rolling</h2>
                <p>Cold rolling is a metal forming technique primarily employed for producing smaller-sized components with enhanced strength. Unlike hot rolling, it involves deforming metal below its recrystallization temperature, often using cluster mills, and results in less thickness reduction. This process improves mechanical properties and surface finish, making it suitable for applications requiring tight dimensional tolerances.</p>
                <p>To enhance ductility in steel, cold rolling is typically followed by annealing in a process known as Cold Rolled and Closed Annealed (CRCA). A specialized variant, skin-rolling, involves minimal thickness reduction and produces a smooth surface finish while suppressing the yield point phenomenon by preventing the formation of Luders bands. This is achieved by locking dislocations at the surface and promoting a dense distribution of unpinned dislocations within the ferrite matrix.</p>
                <p>While cold-rolled products offer superior strength and finish, they exhibit reduced resistance to buckling and torsional stress. They are commonly used in the production of bars, strips, rods, and sheet metals.</p>
                <div><img src="Cimg3.png" class="img"></div>
                <h2>Flat Rolling</h2>
                <p>Flat rolling is the most widely used type of rolling operation. In this process, material is fed between two rollers rotating in opposite directions, with the gap between the rollers set smaller than the initial thickness of the material. This configuration compresses the material to the desired thickness.</p>
                <p>The deformation causes the material to elongate, with the process largely dependent on the friction between the rollers and the material being deformed. If the required reduction in thickness is too great relative to the initial thickness, there is a risk that the rollers may slip over the material's surface without effectively deforming it.</p>
                <p>Therefore, various factors must be carefully considered, including the roller temperature, lubrication requirements, process speed, and the physical and mechanical properties of the material. The process can be labor-intensive, particularly when dealing with bulky materials. However, its primary application today is in metal sheet forming and the production of smaller mechanical components.</p>
                <div><img src="Cimg4.png" class="img"></div>
                <h2>Controlled Rolling</h2>
                <p>Controlled rolling is a thermomechanical processing technique that combines controlled deformation with heat treatment. The heat applied to elevate the workpiece above its recrystallization temperature also facilitates the heat treatment, eliminating the need for subsequent heat treatments. 
                </p>
                <p>The heat treatment processes involved are aimed at producing materials with fine-grain structures, controlling the nature and size of the material, and inducing transformations such as ferrite, austenite, pearlite, and martensite.</p>
                <p>This process is carefully controlled and monitored, taking into account variables such as the initial material composition, structure, level of deformation, and temperature [16]. It is a cost-effective and energy-efficient method, particularly suitable for enhancing the mechanical properties of materials, thereby improving their strength and durability.</p>
                <div><img src="Cimg5.png" class="img"></div>
                <h2>Ring Rolling</h2>
                <p>Ring rolling is a specialized form of hot rolling used to increase the diameter of a ring. The process begins with a thick-walled ring as the starting material, which is positioned between two rolls: an inner idler roll and a driven roll that applies pressure to the ring from the outside. </p>
                <p>During the rolling process, the wall thickness decreases while the diameter increases. The rolls can be shaped to produce various cross-sectional profiles. The resulting grain structure is circumferential, which enhances the mechanical properties of the material. Common applications of ring rolling include railway tires, bearings, gears, rockets, turbines, airplanes, pipes, and pressure vessels.</p>
                <div><img src="Cimg6.png" class="img"></div>
                <h2>Forge Rolling</h2>
                <p>Forge rolling is a longitudinal rolling process used to reduce the cross-sectional area of heated bars or billets by passing them between two oppositely rotating roll segments. This process is primarily employed to achieve optimal material distribution for subsequent die forging operations. </p>
                <p>As a result, forge rolling contributes to improved material utilization, reduced forming forces, and enhanced surface quality in forged components. Most forgeable metals can undergo forge rolling.</p>
                <p> It is mainly used for preforming elongated billets by targeted mass distribution in components such as crankshafts, connecting rods, steering knuckles, and vehicle axles. However, due to its limited ability to meet extremely tight tolerances, forge rolling is typically restricted to preforming rather than finishing operations.</p></section>

                <h1>Rolling Mills</h1>
                <p>A rolling mill primarily comprises a set of rolls, bearings, a housing that encloses these components, and a drive system responsible for transmitting power to the rolls and regulating their speed. Rolling operations typically involve extremely high forces necessitating robust structural rigidity and the use of high-capacity electric motors.</p>
                <p>Rolling mills are commonly classified by the number and arrangement of their rolls:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Two-High Mill :</b> The most basic and widely used type. It consists of two rolls rotating in a single direction. After each pass, the workpiece must be manually returned to the roll entrance, or by using a lift platform.</li>
                        <li><b>Two-High Reversing Mill : </b>Productivity is improved by allowing the rolls to reverse rotation, enabling the workpiece to pass back and forth through the rolls without repositioning.</li>
                        <li><b>Three-High Mill : </b>It contains an upper and lower driven roll and a middle roll that rotates by friction. The workpiece passes in opposite directions on alternate passes, removing the need to return the material manually.</li>
                        <li><b>Four-High Mill:</b> It uses small-diameter work rolls supported by larger backup rolls. This setup allows the rolling of thin sheets with tight tolerances.</li>
                        <li><b>Four-High Mill:</b> It uses small-diameter work rolls supported by larger backup rolls. This setup allows the rolling of thin sheets with tight tolerances.</li>
                        <li><b>Cluster Mill:</b> A more complex version of the four-high mill where each work roll is supported by two backup rolls. This design allows for rolling very thin sheets or foils.</li>
                        <li><b>Sendzimir Mill: </b>A variation of the cluster mill, ideal for rolling thin, high-strength alloys into sheets or foil.</li>
                        <li><b>Planetary rolling:</b> It employs two large backing rolls surrounded by smaller planetary rolls that exert continuous localized deformation on a hot slab, enabling substantial thickness reduction in a single pass, with optional planishing rolls enhancing surface finish.</li>
                        <li><b>Pendulum Mill:</b> It utilizes two small-diameter rolls that oscillate over the arc of contact to incrementally reduce the slab thickness.</li>
                        <li><b>Contact-Bend-Stretch (CBS) Rolling: </b>A modified four-high mill that incorporates a floating bend roll to precisely control strip tension and curvature during rolling.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <section id="applications">
                <h1>Applications of the Rolling Process</h1>
                <p>The rolling process is widely utilized across various industries for the production of numerous components. It is essential in the manufacturing of shafts, rods, tubes, axles, and spindles, as well as in the production of workpieces with specific cross-sectional shapes. Gear manufacturing is another key application, where gear blanks are processed to create precision gears. </p>
                <p>The automotive industry also relies heavily on rolling for the fabrication of numerous parts. Furthermore, the rolling process is instrumental in the production of metal sheets, plates, and panels, which are foundational to many structural applications.</p></section>
                <section id="defects">
                <h1>Defects in Rolling</h1>
                <p>Most defects in metal rolling arise from material imperfections and can be classified into general and operational defects. </p>
                <h2>General Defect</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Surface Inconsistencies:</b> It is caused by scale formation or irregularities in the ingot, leading to laps that remain on the surface. These must be removed through grinding or finishing.</li>
                    <li><b>Non-Metallic Inclusions:</b> Inclusions such as oxides, nitrides, or silicates (especially in steel) may cause internal cracks. High inclusion content can lead to severe "crocodile cracks," splitting the product.</li>
                    <li><b>Internal Pores:</b> Gases (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen) in the raw material may form pores, leading to crack formation and reduced strength.</li>
                    <li><b>Barrel Effect:</b> Due to friction at the die interface, the center of the workpiece expands more than the edges, creating a barrel-shaped profile.</li>
                    <li>Non-Uniform Deformation: It occurs when only the surface is deformed, often due to a higher surface temperature than the core, damaging the slab cross-section.</li>
                    <li><b>Alligator cracks:</b> These are fractures that occur along the slab’s centerline, typically caused by metallurgical weaknesses and the presence of inclusions. These cracks resemble the shape of an open alligator’s mouth, leading to the separation of material along the slab.</li>
                    <li><b>Hydrogen Cracks:</b> It is caused by hydrogen absorbed during melting. Excess hydrogen forms internal cracks during rolling, rendering the material unusable.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Operational Defects</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Mill Spring:</b> It occurs when high rolling forces elastically deform the rolls, making the sheet thicker than intended. To minimize this, rolls with high elastic modulus and cambering are used. Hydraulic jacks can also adjust roll deformation in real-time.</li>
                    <li><b>Thickness Variation:</b> Roll deflection leads to uneven sheet thickness, thicker at the center and thinner at the edges, resulting in waviness or "zipper cracks" due to differential tensile and compressive stresses.</li>
                    <li><b>Edge Cracks:</b> Lateral spreading during rolling is restricted at the center due to higher friction, causing tensile deformation and cracks at the edges.</li>
                    <li><b>Centre Splits: </b>Excessive tensile stress at the restrained center may lead to central cracks.</li>
                    <li><b>Secondary Tensile Stresses:</b> Uneven deformation across thickness leads to tensile stress on edges due to surface bulging, which can be mitigated using edge rolls.</li>
                    <li><b>Alligatoring:</b> It is caused by non-uniform material flow, tensile deformation at the surface and compressive at the core, resulting in delamination along the thickness.</li>
                </ul>
