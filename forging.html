                <p>Forging is a manufacturing process that shapes metals using compressive force. Warm, cold, and hot are the three types of forging that are named based on the temperature which is done. This technique is widely used to produce workpieces in various shapes for a range of discrete parts, such as bolts, rivets, crane hooks, connecting rods, gears, turbine shafts, hand tools, and railroad components .
                </p>
                
                <p>Although forging has been utilized for centuries, its demand surged significantly during the Industrial Revolution, driven by the need for new technologies and the enhancement of material mechanical properties . Forged parts are often preferred over cast parts due to the advantageous grain flow they provide.
                </p>
                <p>Forging can be applied to a wide range of metals and alloys, including aluminum, copper, magnesium, carbon and low steels, nickel, and titanium alloys . It is also ideal for producing heavy-duty components and workpieces with versatile dimensions.

                <h2><b>History of Forging</b></h2>
                <p>The art of forging dates back to as early as 4000 BC, with blacksmiths being the pioneers of these processes. Early forging relied heavily on manual skill and effort, with hammers lifted by hand and workpieces placed on anvils. Some blacksmiths also used hydraulic energy in their workshops.
                </p>
                <p>The tools of the trade included items like set hammers, anvils, swage blocks, tongs, heading tools, fullers, flatters, punches, and drifts. Charcoal was commonly used as an energy source to heat metal pieces to the required forging temperature . 
                </p>
                <p>By the late 19th century, the development of open-hearth steelmaking processes provided the forging industry with a reliable, low-cost raw material for mass production . Furnace types used in forging included continuous and batch furnaces, box-type furnaces, muffle furnaces, and electric resistance heated furnaces .

                <h2><b>Classification of Forging Processes
                </b></h2>
                </br>
                <p>Forging, the shaping of a billet through plastic deformation between dies, is crucial in manufacturing. To optimize these processes, a systematic classification is essential, broadly categorized by workpiece temperature and die arrangement.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><h3><b> Classification based on Temperature of the workpiece</b></h3></li>
                    <h3><b>Hot Forging</b></h3>
                    <p>Hot Forging is the most widely used forging process and is performed at a temperature above the  recrystallization point of the metal. This temperature is the threshold at which new grains form within the metal. The high heat is essential to prevent strain hardening during deformation, ensuring the material remains ductile and easier to shape.</p>
                    <p>Advantages: High strain rates and hence easy flow of the metal, Recrystallization and recovery are possible, Forces required are less.</p>
                    <p>Lubrication is difficult at high temperatures, Oxidation and scaling occur on the work piece, Poor surface finish, Less precise tolerances, Possible warping of the material during the cooling process.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Cold Forging</h3>
                    <p>Cold Forging is performed at or near room temperature, below the metal’s recrystallization point. It is most commonly used for carbon and standard alloy steels, though it is particularly suitable for softer metals like aluminum. Cold forging is often preferred due to its cost-effectiveness and minimal need for post-processing. Additionally, it reduces contamination risks and produces components with superior surface finish and dimensional accuracy.</p>
                    <p>Advantages: Production rates are very high with exceptional die life, Improves mechanical properties, Less friction between die surface and work piece, Lubrication is easy, No oxidation or scaling on the work.
                    </p>
                    <p>Disadvantages: Residual stress may occur, Heavier and more powerful equipment is needed, Stronger tooling is required, Tool design and manufacturing are critical.
                    </p>
                    <h3><b>Warm Forging</b>
                    </h3>
                    <p>The temperature range for the warm forging of steel runs from above room temperature to below the recrystallization temperature. Compared with cold forging, warm forging has the potential advantages of: Reduced tooling loads, reduced press loads, increased steel ductility, elimination of need to anneal prior to forging, and favorable as-forged properties that can eliminate heat treatment. In warm forging, the billet is heated to a temperature below its recrystallization point, typically between 700°C and 800°C for steels, to reduce flow stress and forging pressure, making deformation easier.
                    </p>
                    <p>Advantages: High production rates, Excellent dimensional tolerances and surface finish for forged parts, Significant savings in material and machining, Favorable grain flow to improve strength, Greater toughness of the forged part.
                    </p>
                    
                    <li><h3><b>Classification based on Arrangement of Dies</b></h3>
                    </li>
                    <h3><b> Open Die Forging</b>
                    </h3>
                    <p>Open-Die Forging is a forging process where simple flat dies are used, allowing the material to deform freely in lateral directions under applied force. This method is best suited for shaping simple workpieces but offers lower dimensional accuracy compared to other forging techniques. It requires a skilled operator to control the process effectively. Open-die forging is often used as a preliminary step before closed-die forging to achieve an approximate shape. The dies used in this process are simple and cost-effective, making it the most basic and straightforward forging operation.
                    </p>
                    <div><a href="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/forging/open-vs-closed-die.html"><img src="img2.jpeg" class="img"></a></div>
                    <h3><b> Impression-Die Forging </b>
                    </h3>
                    <p>Impression-Die Forging is a process where the material is shaped to conform to a die cavity formed by the upper and lower die halves. The dies do not fully close, allowing excess material to escape as flash. This flash formation increases internal pressure within the workpiece, promoting better material flow into unfilled die impressions. Due to the complexity of the process, it requires more intricate and expensive dies. 
                    </p>
                    <h3><b> Significance of Flash</b>
                    </h3>
                    <p> Flash plays a crucial role in ensuring the complete filling of the die cavity by initially allowing excess metal to be used, preventing void formation. As the forging process progresses, this excess metal is squeezed out as a thin strip, known as flash. To manage this, a flash gutter is incorporated to control the flash area. The thinness of the flash increases flow resistance, generating high internal pressure, which helps fill intricate cavity details. Proper flash design is critical, as an excessively thin flash can lead to extreme pressure buildup, potentially causing die failure.
                    </p>
                    <div><a href="https://www.dropforging.net/types-of-forging-processes.html"><img src="img3.jpeg" class="img"></a></div>
                    <h3><b> Closed Die Forging</b>
                    </h3>
                    <p>It is a forging process in which the material is fully confined within a die cavity formed by the upper and lower die halves. This method enables the production of highly accurate and precisely shaped parts. Unlike other forging techniques, no flash is formed, eliminating material waste. However, it requires higher interface pressures and precise control over material volume. As a specialized form of impression-die forging, closed-die forging does not rely on flash formation for complete die filling. Instead, the material is deformed within a tightly enclosed cavity, placing greater emphasis on precise die design to ensure proper shaping.
                    </p>
                    <p>Features: Work is rough forged close to final shape by blocking die, Work is forged to final shape and dimensions by Finishing die, Both blocking die and finishing die are machined into the same die block, More number of dies are required depending on the complexity of the job, Two die halves close-in and work is deformed under high pressure, High dimensional accuracy/close control on tolerances, Suitable for complex shapes, Dies are complex and more expensive, Large production rates are necessary to justify high costs.

                <h2><b> Additional Types of Forging</b>
                </h2>
                <h3><b>Isothermal Forging Processes
                </b></h3>
                <p>In conventional forging, die chilling occurs when heat flows from the workpiece to the die surfaces, creating thermal gradients within the material. This results in non-uniform plastic deformation, as colder die regions restrict metal flow compared to the hotter core areas. Typically, die temperatures range from 400–500°F (205–260°C). To minimize chilling effects, high-speed forging machines, hammers, screw presses, and mechanical presses are used. Additionally, glass lubricants help reduce thermal chilling. In isothermal forging, the die is heated to the same temperature as the workpiece, significantly reducing chilling and ensuring uniform deformation.
                </p>
                <p>The Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) has successfully implemented isothermal forging techniques, particularly for high-pressure compressors (HPC) used in titanium alloy deformation. This technology, developed by the Defense Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) in Hyderabad, has contributed to self-reliance in India’s aerospace industry.
                </p>
                <h3><b>Press Forging Process
                </b></h3>
                <p>Press forging involves shaping metal by placing it between two dies and applying mechanical or hydraulic pressure. This process is carried out using a forge press, which exerts gradual and continuous pressure rather than sudden impact. The workpiece takes its shape through a single stroke in each die, progressing through a series of aligned dies to achieve the final form.
                </p>
                <p>Primarily used for heavy forging of large metal sections, press forging ensures uniform deformation through sustained pressure from hydraulic presses. These presses typically range in capacity from 5 to 500 MN, with 10 to 100 MN being the most commonly used. Compared to open-die forging, press forging requires less flash and draft, making it more efficient. It is widely applied in coining and hubbing processes.
                </p>
                <p>Over the past two decades, press forging has emerged as a viable technique for manufacturing thin-walled electronic components from magnesium alloys. Unlike traditional methods that rely on thick sheets, this process compresses a thicker sheet along the pressure direction to achieve the desired thin-walled structure.
                </p>
                <h3><b>Roll Forging Process
                </b></h3>
                <p>Roll forging is primarily performed under hot working conditions and can be classified into different types based on tool setup, motion, and the shape of the workpiece. The main types include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Longitudinal Rolling:</b>The workpiece undergoes translational motion between two rotating tools, moving parallel to its axis.</li>
                    <li><b>Cross Rolling:
                    </b>The workpiece rotates between two tools that have the same rotary motion as the job. Due to point contact between the tools and the workpiece, the job moves along a plane perpendicular to its axis.
                    </li>
                     
                    <li><b>Helical Rolling:
                    </b>The workpiece experiences both translational and rotary motion, while the rolls also rotate in the same direction. The point of contact between the tools and the workpiece results in a central movement.
                    </li>                            
                </ul>
                    
                <p>Roll forging is now widely used for reducing cross-sections and redistributing metal within a billet, minimizing the need for extensive work with forging hammers or presses.</p>
                <h3>Net-Shape or Near Net-Shape Forging

                </h3>
                <p>This forging process deforms metal within a precisely designed cavity, eliminating flash formation and achieving highly accurate final dimensions. It produces components that require minimal or no machining, reducing material waste and processing time. The resulting parts are often stronger, enhancing the overall performance of applications such as engines.
                </p>
                <p>Net-shape forging utilizes dies with exceptional dimensional precision, demanding higher driving power compared to conventional forging methods. Commonly forged components using this technique include gears, turbine blades, fuel injection nozzles, and bearing castings.

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Upsetting or Jumping:
                    </b><br> Upsetting is a smith forging process used to increase the thickness or diameter of a bar while reducing its length. It is typically applied in specific cases, such as forming bolt heads. During this process, the area to be upset is heated locally, while the rest of the bar is quenched in water to prevent any unwanted effects on the surrounding material. The process requires great care to ensure that the unaffected parts of the material do not bend or deform.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Drawing Down:</b> <br>Drawing down is the reverse of the upsetting process, where the bar's thickness is reduced, resulting in an increase in its length. The metal is placed over the horn of the anvil, and then struck with a hammer on the face of the anvil to elongate it.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Bending:</b><br> Bending is a fundamental forging operation used to shape metal by introducing a turn or curve. The process involves supporting the metal piece on the anvil while applying a compressive force, such as hammering, to its free end to achieve the desired bend.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Cutting:
                    </b><br>Cutting is a widely used process in which red-hot metal is divided into sections using chisels or modern diamond-cutting tools. This technique allows precise shaping and sizing of metal pieces for further processing.
                    </li>

                <h2> Forging Equipment
                </h2>
                <p>Forged components are shaped using either hammers or presses. In hammer forging, the workpiece is deformed through repeated blows within a series of die impressions. The quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of this process largely depend on the tooling and the operator's skill.
                </p>
                <p>In contrast, press forging typically involves a single strike per die impression, making die design more critical while reducing the reliance on operator expertise. The advancement of forging technology demands a thorough understanding of equipment capabilities and characteristics.
                </p>
                <p>Forging machines, including presses and hammers, play a crucial role in the process as they influence deformation rates, temperature conditions, and overall production efficiency. The success of a forging operation depends on selecting equipment that aligns with the required load, energy, processing time, and accuracy specifications.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Forging Hammer
                    </b></li>
                    <p>The forging hammer, along with the anvil, is one of the most commonly used and versatile types of forging equipment. It is also one of the most cost-effective methods for generating load and energy in forging operations. This technique involves multiple impact blows between contoured dies and is primarily used for hot forging.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are two main types of anvil hammers: Gravity-drop hammers and Power-drop hammers. In a gravity-drop hammer, the upper ram is connected to a board (board-drop hammer), belt (belt-drop hammer), chain (chain-drop hammer), or piston (oil-, air-, or steam-lift drop hammer). The ram is lifted to a certain height and then released, striking the workpiece on the anvil with force generated by gravity. The ram is then immediately lifted for the next stroke.
                    </p>
                    <p>Power-drop hammers operate similarly to air-drop hammers but provide additional acceleration to the ram using steam, cold air, or hot air pressure. In these hammers, air pressure is applied to the top side of the ram cylinder, further increasing the force of impact.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mechanical Board Hammer: A stroke-restricted machine in which a board (weight) is lifted by friction rolls and dropped onto the die. It is rated based on the ram's weight and the energy delivered.
                        </li>
                        <li>Steam Hammer: Utilizes a piston-cylinder mechanism powered by steam, allowing for greater forging capacity. Steam hammers can produce forgings ranging from a few kilograms to several tons and are especially preferred in closed-die forging.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <div><a href="https://www.dropforging.net/image/Steam%20hammer.png"><img src="img6.jpeg" class="img"></a></div>
                    <li><b>Forging Press</b></li>
                    <p>In press forging, metal is shaped through a continuous squeezing action rather than a series of impact blows, as seen in hammer forging. There are two primary types of forging presses: mechanical presses and hydraulic presses.
                    </p>
                    <p>Mechanical presses operate using cams, cranks, or toggles to deliver a predetermined force at specific stroke positions. The force varies throughout the stroke, allowing for high-speed operation—up to 50 strokes per minute. These presses have capacities ranging from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 short tons-force) and are known for their efficiency in mass production.
                    </p>
                    <p>Hydraulic presses, on the other hand, generate force using fluid pressure and a piston. Unlike mechanical presses, they provide a consistent press load throughout the full stroke. They function more through a squeezing action rather than hammering, which results in longer die life and reduced tool wear.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Features of Hydraulic Press:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maintains full press load throughout the stroke
                            </li>
                            <li>Allows controlled and variable ram velocity
                            </li>
                            <li>Operates at a slower speed, leading to higher die temperatures due to longer contact time
                            </li>
                            <li>Produces forgings with closer tolerances
                            </li>
                            <li>Higher initial cost compared to hammers
                            </li>
                        <ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Advantages & Disadvantages:<br>A hydraulic press offers greater flexibility and higher capacity than a mechanical press. However, it operates at a slower speed, requires more space, and is costlier to maintain and operate.

                <h2><b>Selection of Forging Machine
                </b></h2>
                <p>The choice of a forging machine depends on several factors, including the force and energy requirements needed for the process. The type of material being forged plays a crucial role—soft materials are better suited for press forging, whereas harder materials require hammer forging. 
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, the size, shape, and complexity of the forging influence machine selection, as more intricate components may need specialized equipment. The strength of the workpiece material and its sensitivity to the rate of deformation also impact the choice, as certain materials require controlled deformation rates.
                </p>
                <p>Production rate is another important consideration, with some machines offering faster operation than others. Dimensional accuracy varies between different types of forging equipment, making precision a key factor in selection. 
                </p>
                <p>Maintenance requirements, operating skill levels, and noise levels must also be taken into account, as they affect long-term efficiency and workplace conditions.

                <section id="defects">
                <h2><b>Forging Defects</b></h2>
                <p>Forging defects can significantly impact the quality and functionality of a component. Identifying their root causes, taking corrective actions, and implementing preventive measures is crucial to maintaining a high-quality forging process. Below are some common forging defects along with their causes and remedies:
                <ol>
                    <li><b> Incomplete Forging Penetration </b>occurs when the dendritic ingot structure inside the forging remains unbroken, and deformation happens only at the surface. This is usually caused by light and rapid hammer blows. The solution is to use a forging press for full penetration.</li>
                    <li><b>Surface Cracking</b>is caused by excessive surface working at low temperatures, leading to fractures. Increasing the work temperature can help prevent such cracks.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Cracking at the Flash</b>happens when the flash is too thin, causing cracks that may extend into the interior after trimming. To avoid this, the flash thickness should be increased, relocated to a less critical area, or hot trimming and stress-relieving techniques should be used.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Cold Shut (Fold) </b>occurs when two metal surfaces fold against each other without proper welding, often due to sharp corners, excessive chilling, or high friction. The remedy is to increase the fillet radius in the die to facilitate smoother metal flow.</li>
                    <li><b> Unfilled Section (Underfilling)</b>results from an improperly designed forging die, insufficient raw material, or inadequate heating, leaving some areas of the die cavity unfilled. Ensuring proper die design, adequate material, and optimal heating conditions can resolve this issue.</li>
                    <li><b>Die Shift (Mismatch)</b>happens when the die halves are not aligned properly, leading to misalignment at the flash line. This can be prevented by ensuring precise die alignment, possibly by incorporating notches on the upper and lower dies to match during setup.</li>
                    <li><b>Scale Pits (Pit Marks)</b>appear as irregular depressions on the surface due to oxide and scale embedding during forging. Proper cleaning of the stock before forging is essential to avoid this defect.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Flakes</b>are internal ruptures caused by rapid cooling, which creates uneven cooling rates between the exterior and interior. Following proper cooling procedures can prevent this issue.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Improper Grain Flow </b>results from incorrect die design that restricts the natural metal flow. To fix this, the die design should be optimized to ensure a uniform and intended grain structure.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Residual Stresses in Forging</b> occur due to inhomogeneous deformation and improper cooling (quenching). A controlled slow cooling process inside a furnace or under insulating materials such as ash can minimize residual stresses and improve the component’s structural integrity.
                    </li>

                </ol>
                <p>By understanding these defects and their solutions, manufacturers can improve forging efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance the quality of forged components.
